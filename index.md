## About
---
This website is created to introduce some basic algorithms for rookie computer scientists. I will talk about how they work, their correctness, implementation, and time & space complexity for best, worst, and average cases. It can help rookie computer scientists have a rough overview of those algorithms and lay a firm foundation for future algorithms study.
