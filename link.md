Rathore, Amit. *Sorting Algorithms -- With Python*. Towards Data Science.April 13, 2021. [https://towardsdatascience.com/sorting-algorithms-with-python-4ec7081d78a1](https://towardsdatascience.com/sorting-algorithms-with-python-4ec7081d78a1)

This link is an article post on website "Towards Data Science". It introduce many common sorting algorithms -- from basic starters to complicated real life ones. This article also includes time/space analysis and Python impletation of each one. Readers who want to know more in detail of sorting algorithms can go through the article to learn about analysis of these algorithms or how to implement these in Python.

Quiles, Luis. *Merge Sort*. Florida Institute of Technology. [https://cs.fit.edu/~pkc/classes/writing/hw13/luis.pdf](https://cs.fit.edu/~pkc/classes/writing/hw13/luis.pdf)

This links to an scholar article introduce merge sort, which is. Merge sort is a relative quick algorithm and is practical in real life situation. Readers intersted in more efficient but more complex algorithm can read the article for more information.
